# Basic Flask API

## What is the purpose of this project?

This project was made as a exercise of some programming pratices. The objective is create a simple API that can process some financial operation, but this API must be malleable to allow extensions and modifications. 
My major concern is about cognitive complexity (which is the effort that is required to understand what was created and to make changes), based on it some decisions was made focusing in a more pragmatic approach (nothing _by the book_).
